# Slide Presentation Web App - Brainstorm Document

## 1. The Idea

**Simple Markdown-Powered Slide Sharing**

A minimalist web application that transforms markdown files into shareable slide presentations. The core concept is to eliminate the complexity of traditional presentation software by using markdown syntax for content creation and providing a clean, distraction-free viewing experience that can be instantly shared via URL.

**Problem Statement:** Traditional presentation tools are often overkill for simple concept sharing, requiring complex software installations, account setups, or heavyweight platforms when you just want to share a few key points with someone quickly.

**Solution:** A lightweight web app that reads markdown content and presents it as navigable slides, allowing for instant sharing and easy content updates through file replacement.
